#The purpose of this code is to create a script using AWS provider that creates 2 instances and 1 RDS instance with the
#following properties:
#1. All instances should be able to communicate with the RDS instance
#2. All instances should reside in the same VPC
#3. The RDS instance should not be accessible from the public internet
#4. For bonus points: Add a load balancer that ensures that traffic is not distrupted if the one if the instances goes down


#prior running the code please note the followings :
# 1. add your access key to the variables file
# 2. add your key name in step 9
# 3. you can access the db instance from the two instances using this command: ' mysql -u root -h endpoint_name -p ' where endpoint_name is generated by aws, password is: complex1891
